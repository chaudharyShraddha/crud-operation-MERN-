Pokemon crud operation
Need to create frontend in React.js and backend in Node.js with MongoDB. The functionality will be like,

1) Users can see all the pokemon on the list. Users can also search the pokemon based on the name from the list. Pagination will be a bonus point here.
2) Users can create a new pokemon. Users need to add pokemon details like name and image URL. Add proper validations Here.
3) Users can update the existing pokemon details.
4) Users can delete single pokemon.
